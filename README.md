> A home lab project built to practice the full lifecycle of a security incident — from raw packet capture to a written report — using the same categories of tooling found in real SOC environments. Built in 15 days as a self-directed program, not a job; treat this as evidence of hands-on initiative going into entry-level SOC / security operations roles.

## About

I'm **Charl Mae E. Tapia**, an aspiring SOC Analyst building hands-on detection and response skills outside the classroom.

**Lab stack:** Splunk Enterprise · BOTSv2 Dataset · Wireshark · Kali Linux · [Honeypot tool] · [Ticketing platform]

<hr style="border: 2px solid #1B9CFC; border-radius: 5px;" />

## Case Files

Each case below mirrors a real SOC workflow stage — detection, response, network forensics, and adversary intelligence — and links to the supporting evidence folder in this repo.


### CASE-001 · SIEM Threat Detection & Dashboard Build
`Detection & Monitoring` · `Splunk Enterprise` · `BOTSv2 Dataset` · `SPL` · **Status: Documented**

**Objective:** Stand up a working SIEM environment and turn raw security logs into actionable visual monitoring, using "Boss of the SOC" v2 — an industry-standard dataset simulating a real breach against a fictional company.

**What I did:**
- Ingested and explored the BOTSv2 dataset in Splunk, learning its index and sourcetype structure before writing any searches.
- Wrote SPL queries to surface indicators of compromise — identify suspicious activity.
- Designed and built Splunk dashboards from scratch: panels, visualizations, and time-range controls for a fast read on environment health.
- Rehearsed the dashboard as a live demo, practicing how to walk a non-technical audience through what each panel means.

**Skills demonstrated:** SPL query writing · log correlation · dashboard design · technical presenting

📁 Evidence: [`/01-splunk-siem-monitoring`](./01-splunk-siem-monitoring) https://github.com/tapiacharl04-design/charmeer/blob/main/docs/01-splunk-siem-monitoring-README.md — SPL queries, dashboard exports, screenshots

<hr style="border: 2px solid #1B9CFC; border-radius: 5px;" />

### CASE-002 · Incident Triage, Ticketing & Reporting
`Incident Response` · `[Ticketing platform]` · **Status: Documented**

**Objective:** Practice the part of SOC work that happens after detection — deciding what matters, tracking it, and writing it up the way a real analyst hands a case off to the next shift.

**What I did:**
- Logged alerts and findings from the Splunk dashboard work as tickets, rather than leaving them as one-off searches.
- Practiced triage: assigning priority and severity based on its critical level instead of treating every alert the same.
- Wrote structured incident reports for higher-priority cases — summary, timeline, indicators of compromise, and recommended remediation.
- Treated documentation as a deliverable in itself.

**Skills demonstrated:** alert triage · prioritization · ticketing workflows · incident report writing

📁 Evidence: [`/02-incident-response`](./02-incident-response) (./02-incident-response-README.md) — report template and example tickets

<hr style="border: 2px solid #1B9CFC; border-radius: 5px;" />

### CASE-003 · Network Traffic & Packet Analysis
`Network Forensics` · `Wireshark` · **Status: Documented**

**Objective:** Build the habit of reading raw network traffic instead of trusting summaries.

**What I did:**
- Captured and analyzed live and saved traffic in Wireshark, reading the protocol hierarchy before drilling into individual frames.
- Used display filters to isolate specific conversations and suspicious patterns — unknown ports and repeated connection attempts.
- Followed TCP streams end-to-end to reconstruct what happened in a session.
- Compared baseline "normal" traffic against anomalous captures.

**Skills demonstrated:** packet analysis · Wireshark filters · traffic baselining · anomaly identification

📁 Evidence: [`/03-wireshark-traffic-analysis`](./03-wireshark-traffic-analysis) — capture notes and filter examples

<hr style="border: 2px solid #1B9CFC; border-radius: 5px;" />

### CASE-004 · Honeypot Deployment & Threat Intelligence
`Adversary Intelligence` · `Kali Linux` · `[Honeypot tool]` · **Status: Documented**

**Objective:** Get a firsthand look at what automated attackers actually do, by giving them something to attack inside a safely isolated home lab.

**What I did:**
- Built and isolated a home lab network segment so the honeypot could be exposed without putting other devices at risk.
- Deployed a honeypot on Kali Linux to passively log connection attempts, credentials tried, and commands run.
- Reviewed the resulting logs for patterns — common usernames/passwords attempted, scanning behavior, follow-on actions.
- Cross-referenced honeypot activity with Wireshark captures of the same traffic.

**Skills demonstrated:** honeypot configuration · network segmentation · log analysis · attacker TTP identification

📁 Evidence: [`/04-kali-honeypot-homelab`](./04-kali-honeypot-homelab) — network diagram and log analysis notes
